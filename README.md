# Problem

Predict the hourly production of 6 independent wind farms for the day ahead, using recent production data and weather predictions of different national models.

https://challengedata.ens.fr/challenges/34

Time-series prediction with 1h time step.

Train set:
* six wind farms (WF) hourly production data from May the 1st of 2018 to January the 15th of 2019 (8 months and 15 days)
* hourly forecasted meteorological variables, provided by several Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models

Prediction target:
* day-ahead WF hourly production of the six WF

Constraint:
* day-ahead predictions must be computed with data that are available in real operational conditions on day D at 09h00 UTC

Test set: 
* Data from January the 16th of 2019 to September the 30rd of 2019 (8 months and 15 days)

Complementary observed data (shouldn't be used directly in the model):
* hourly wind speeds and wind directions observed at the height of each wind turbine

NWP models:    

NWP Variable | Prediction description | NWP 1 (hourly) | NWP 2 (every 3 hours) | NWP 3 (every 3 hours) | NWP 4 (hourly)
------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | -----
Wind speed U,V (m/s) | 10min average [H-10min,H] | x (@100m) | x (@100m) | x (@100m) | x (@10m)
Temperature of air T (m/s) | 1hour average [H-1,H] | x |  | x |
Total cloud cover CLCT (%) | instant value at H | | | | x

Tips: 
* Train 1 model per WF
* derive wind speed (and wind direction) from U and V
* reconstruct NWP time series

# My approach
**[ongoing work]**

## Make a weather forecast matrix

In the datasets, each line gives the different weather predictions for a given target datetime. These predictions are multiple: several predictions models are used to predict several weather variables, and these models are run at different each days. 
In other words, for each triplet (prediction model, weather variable, target datetime), we have several predictions made at different time. 
It is then interesting to calculate the "best" prediction value for each triplet, using the fact that recent predictions should be more predominant in the calculation than the older ones.

To do that, I have implemented a weighted mean of the prediction values. We then have : 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=V_{best}=\dfrac{\sum_{k=1}^{n}\alpha^{\Delta H_k}\,V_k}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}\alpha^{\Delta H_k}}"/>

where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=V_k"/> is the k-th prediction made for a given triplet, which has been produced <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta H_k"/> hours before the target datetime. 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha"/> is a memory coefficient lying in <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=[0,1]"/>, which make the value weight <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha^{\Delta H_k}"/> decaying as the delay <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta H_k"/> increases. We take a value of 0.9 to start with this hyperparameter.

## Make a train set of sequences based on a "best weather prediction" matrix.
